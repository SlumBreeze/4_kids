    "rating": "Safe",
    "reasoning": "Bluey is a safe and highly recommended show for children, focusing on imaginative play, positive family dynamics, and social-emotional learning. The gentle, humorous content and TV-Y rating make it suitable for a very broad audience, despite one character being shown to have two mothers. Any \"violence\" is limited to the very mild, non-threatening rough-and-tumble of children's play.",

    "rating": "Safe",
    "reasoning": "The content is physically safe, featuring non-violent, lighthearted nursery rhymes and basic social/educational concepts for infants and toddlers. However, the show is widely criticized for its extremely high stimulation level, including rapid pacing, frantic scene cuts, and over-saturated colors which can condition children to crave constant sensory input. The spin-off *Cocomelon Lane* also includes an episode featuring a same-sex couple.",
