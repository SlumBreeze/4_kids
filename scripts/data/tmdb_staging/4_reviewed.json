Set mainly on the fictional planet of Shuggazoom, the series follows the adventures of five cyborg monkeys and a human boy named Chiro as they struggle to protect their planet - and the rest of the universe - from the forces of evil.\n\nAs is obvious from the visual appearance of the show, there is a significant anime influence present, despite being produced for American television. It was also influenced by Star Trek, Super Sentai, Voltron, and Star Wars. The show also contains various references to pop culture, a notable example being the episode \"Season of the Skull\", which is a parody of the 1970s thriller The Wicker Man.",

      "reasoning": "Rocket Power is highly stimulating due to its focus on fast-paced extreme sports action, frequent wipeouts, and competitive spirit. While it features slapstick violence (falls/minor injuries) and encourages risk-taking, the overall tone is comedic and promotes positive values like persistence and teamwork. It is safely targeted at children aged 7 and older (TV-Y7)."
